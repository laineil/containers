## About Jupyter Docker Stacks

Jupyter Docker Stacks are a set of ready-to-run [laineil/containers/app/jupyter](https://github.com/laineil/containers/tree/main/app/jupyter) containing Jupyter applications and interactive computing tools.

You can use a stack image to do any of the following (and more):

- Start a personal Jupyter Server with the JupyterLab frontend (default).
- Run JupyterLab for a team using JupyterHub.
- Start a personal Jupyter Server with the Jupyter Notebook frontend in a local Docker container.
- Write your own project Dockerfile.

- GitHub Actions in the [laineil/containers/app/jupyter](https://github.com/laineil/containers/tree/main/app/jupyter) project builds and pushes this image to Docker Hub.

- Jupyter project documentation [Jupyter Docker Stacks on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
